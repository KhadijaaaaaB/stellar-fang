                      HOW TO PLAY STELLAR FANG
================================================================

Your mission is to find and repair a critical system failure on
the V.S.S. Stellar Fang before time runs out. Follow these
steps to save the ship.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. >> DIAGNOSE THE FAILURE

   Use 'ls' and 'cd' to explore the ship's four main systems.
   Each system contains a 'status.txt' file. Find the one that
   reports a CRITICAL ERROR to identify the broken part.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. >> GATHER REPAIR PARTS

   Read the error message in the status file to see which parts
   are needed. Then, find the 'EMERGENCY_REPAIR_GUIDE' and
   follow its instructions to locate the replacement parts in
   the 'Storage' archives and move them to the correct
   'forrepair' directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. >> NEUTRALIZE THE VIRUS

   A hidden background process (a "virus") is preventing the
   final repair script from appearing. Use 'ps T' to find this
   rogue process and 'kill <PID>' to terminate it. Once the
   virus is gone, 'repair_protocol.sh' will be accessible.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. >> PREPARE THE REPAIR SCRIPT

   The 'repair_protocol.sh' script is locked by default. You
   must use 'chmod +x repair_protocol.sh' to make it
   executable before you can run it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. >> EXECUTE THE REPAIR

   Run './repair_protocol.sh' to fix the ship's systems. If
   all steps were completed correctly, you will save the
   Stellar Fang and win the game.
